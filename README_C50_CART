To run program
---------------

	Start up R
	    to install packages: run....

	            install.packages("partykit")
	            install.packages("rpart")
	            install.packages("C50")

	    navigate to the folder where the data files are kept (just outside of the src folder)

	               setwd("path_to_project/DM_Project/")

	           where path_to_project is the path to where DM_Project is saved

		then run....

		    source("src/C50.R")

		 replacing C50.R with any of the following.
		
	 C50.R will run the C5.0 algorithm on the PlayTennis Dataset
	 C50_real_data.R will run C5.0 on the large Security Dataset
	 cart.r will run the CART algorithm on the PlayTennis Dataset
	 CART_real.R will run the CART algorithm on the large Security Dataset
